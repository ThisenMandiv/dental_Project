                Sugar-free September is all about giving up the sugars that are added to our foods and drinks (these are called extrinsic sugars if you're interested in the sciencey bit).
              </p>

              <p>
                We already have more than enough sugar in our diets from naturally-occurring sources such as whole fruits, vegetables and milk (these are intrinsic sugars) and we don't need the refined and processed sugar on top!
              </p>

              <p>
                So why not join Denplan and go sugar-free this September and see how much better you feel? After a month, you may even adjust how much sugar you consume going forward, which can only be a good thing!

                Smokers across the country have signed up to Stoptober 2016, a 28-day mass quit attempt from Public Health England (PHE), to receive support and encouragement every step of the way from some of the nation's top comedians.
              </p>

              <p>
                But do they also realise that the added benefits that being smoke-free can have on their mouths?
              </p>

              <p>
                It is at the heart of what we do. Smokers are at a significantly higher risk of suffering from gum disease, tooth decay and even mouth cancer. Regular visits to their dentist play a vital role in detecting early signs of potential problems.
              </p>

              <p>
                And to stand an even better chance of quitting, they are encouraged to sign up with their friends, family and colleagues, as evidence reveals that that type of 'social' quitting can significantly improve chances of success. In 2014, smokers taking part in Stoptober were 67% more likely to quit when their spouse quits smoking and 36% more likely when a colleague quits * so why not encourage your employees to sign up and take advantage of the personalised support that Stoptober?
              </p>
