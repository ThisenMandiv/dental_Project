I adore the countryside, I love to go cycling and really need to take part in charitable events. I like sewing and watching the occasional good box set!

I adore kids and would love to go visit places like The Eden Project and Capability Browns parks! I absolutely love my work with kids. I trained it well when my preschool children were involved and look forward to restoring oral health in the NHS!`
