This is done so that the technician making your crown or bridge is able to construct it correctly so it will sit within your bite. At this appointment, the dentist will also choose the shade for the crown or bridge which most closely matches the natural shade of your teeth.
The impressions are then sent to a dental lab, where the technician will build the crown or bridge. This normally takes approximately two weeks so in the meantime your dentist may put a temporary crown or bridge on your tooth or teeth to protect during this time.`,

It is therefore extremely important to make sure that you clean around the crown or bridge as you would your own teeth and use to use floss or interdental brushes to clean in between the crown or bridge and adjacent teeth.
It may be necessary for you to see the dental hygienist more regularly to ensure that the restorations are kept in good condition.`,
