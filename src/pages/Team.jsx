I am a Dentist who provides NHS and some Private Dentistry. I am particularly interested in preventative Dentistry and Endodontics (Root Canal Treatment).

As a mother in the preschool home, abroad play, volunteer in school.

It's always been my passion to restore people's teeth and ensure that they are fit and healthy with no underlying chronic infections and my experience covers 15 years as a Dentist.

I adore the countryside, I love to go cycling and really need to take part in charitable events. I like sewing and watching the occasional good box set!

I adore kids and would love to go visit places like The Eden Project and Capability Browns parks! I absolutely love my work with kids. I trained it well when my preschool children were involved and look forward to restoring oral health in the NHS!`
